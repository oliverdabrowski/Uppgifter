            <p class="lead">The Indie Quest is a course in programming, art, and production, specifically
              designed for creating indie games. Instead of studying individual subjects in
              isolation, you acquire the skills directly by using them on game projects.
              You will first become an apprentice, completing carefully designed game coding
              missions that will build your programming knowledge step-by-step. You will then
              extend these foundations by learning advanced concepts while creating your own
              games. Applying project management strategies will help you prototype your ideas
              and polish the end result to share your games with the world.
              On the art side of things you will choose any visual style that you want for your
              games.</p>

              <h3 class="card-title">The way we teach</h3>
              <p class="lead">There are no exams in our school. You will not have to write project reports or
                memorize theory. All that matters is what you are able to create and your completed
                games will demonstrate that.
                We use the flipped classroom model to make sure you get all the help you need to
                master your skills. Instead of listening to a teacher lecturing everyone at the same
                speed, you will use online educational materials to learn at your own pace. Some
                concepts might take longer to conquer, other times you will breeze ahead. The
                teacher will be there to answer any specific questions and help you individually when
                you need it.
                You will share an office space with other students and a teacher so you can learn
                and create a environment.</p>
