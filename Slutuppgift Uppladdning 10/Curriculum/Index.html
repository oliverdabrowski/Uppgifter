              <h2>1. Preparation</h2>
              <p>The Indie Quest requires no previous experience in programming. Through carefully
                designed missions, you will conquer the basics of programming by coding individual
                aspects of games. You will learn how computers work and touch on other aspects of
                computer science, such as computational thinking and algorithm design, so that you
                will have the foundation to tackle any programming problems thrown your way.<br>
                Skills covered:<br>● How computers work<br>● Procedural programming<br>● Algorithm design basics<br>● Data types and structures<br>● Text manipulation<br>● User interaction</p>

              adventure with various locations, characters, and objects to manipulate. It&#39;s up to you
              what the goal of the game is. The project will be bigger than previous missions and

                Before we move on to more learning, you will participate in a 72-hours game jam that
                will bring everyone at Spellkolektivet together to create games. These games are based around a
                shared theme. You could work alone or take the opportunity to team up, either with
                other students or join the rest of the developers from the house. </div>

                    <div class="row">
                      <div class="col-lg-4">The concepts you will learn in the first two sections of the programming curriculum
                        will be highly universal and applicable to any kind of programming tasks, in and
                        outside video games. Sections 3–5 will be specific to game development, but giving
                        you a high-level understanding of how games work that can be applied to any game
                        type and approach. <br>
                        To make teaching practical however, we had to choose a specific programming
                        language and game engine around which to organize the learning materials. We
                        chose Unity since it is the most popular engine in indie game development and one
                        you are most likely to encounter when trying to collaborate with other indie
                        developers. Based on this decision, C# was the logical choice for the programming
                        language. <br>

                        While some of the concepts common in the gaming industry will not be covered due
                        to this choice (for example, pointers and manual memory management), you will
                        receive enough low-level knowledge about how computers work that you will not
                        have problems moving to C or C++ if you choose to afterwards. Learning a specific
                        programming language is not the hard part and a skilled programmer with
                        understanding of general concepts has no problem switching and learning a new
                        programming language. Similarly, moving from Unity to another engine will not be
                        hard if you decide to do so. </div>

                              create all the necessary art assets for the projects. You are required to learn the
                              basics of raster and vector digital art production (2D or 3D), but beyond that, it&#39;s
                              completely up to you what kind of art styles, mediums, and themes you want to
                              explore. For each of the 4 main projects you will choose a goal and follow a
                              personalized study plan that will lead you to creating all of the art.<br>Possible areas of study:<br>● Art fundamentals<br>○ Light and color<br>○ Graphical projections<br>○ Composition<br>○ Animation<br><br>● Design process<br>○ Art direction<br>○ Concept art<br><br>● Art mediums<br>○ Pixel art<br>○ Voxel art<br>○ Vector art<br>○ 3D modeling<br>○ Traditional drawing<br>○ Digital painting<br>○ Shader programming and visual effects<br><br>● Subjects<br>○ Landscapes<br>○ Vegetation<br>○ Architecture<br>○ Interiors<br>○ Items<br>○ Vehicles<br>○ Characters<br>○ Animals</p>

                                    choose the tools you want to make your art with, both digital and traditional. You will
                                    be responsible for obtaining your own software and hardware, but we made sure all
                                    the assignments can be completed with free software, a mouse, some paper, and a
                                    pencil. Any extra hardware (graphic tablets and displays, pens, art markers …) or
                                    paid software is optional and only required if you decide to pursue certain art styles.
                                    The school will have some art materials available, but if you have your own art
                                    supplies, definitely bring them along.</p>
